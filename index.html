        <!-- Tom or someone doing a lay out-->

        <p class="fs-2">
          Bullseye Ultimate is a Club committed to growing the opportunities for young frisbee players in Perth.
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-3"> Who are we?</h2>
        <p class="fs-2">
          Since our club began in ?2014? we put culture and the spirit of the game first. Our men's team won the Spirit
          of
          theGame Award for the Division 2 Australian Ultimate Championships two years in a row in 2018 and 2019. The
          focus
          on
          safe play and calm discussions is championed by our club.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-2">
          The Perth Ultimate scene as been gradually growing over the past 20 years and we think it is our role to give
          young
          frisbee players an opportunity to play and improve in our favorite sport.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-2">
          The club has been partnering with Shenton College to provide some Ultimate coaching after school, and we
          stoked to
          have a place for our young members test their skills
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-3">Street League Ultimate</h2>

        <p class="fs-2">
          Street League is an Ultimate Frisbee league that started up earlier this year because a group of super
          passionate
          people thought they could run a league better than what already existed in Perth. And they were right! They
          are
          now
          an incorporated club and ready to include youth in their league.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-2">
          Jono Jones and Ben Guadin are coaches that have been providing Youth Frisbee at Shenton since the start of
          2021
          and
          will be the Captains/Coaches at these games providing coaching and making sure that everything is running
          smoothly.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-2">
          To help keep the team competitive we will have some Bullseye Senior members playing too so that our team has a
          competitive chance.
