        <h2> Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
        When our Ultimate club was founded in late 2014, we knew that our focus would always be on culture, spirit, and sportsmanship. Since that first year with only a men’s team, we have grown to include women’s, mixed, and youth teams, along with annual international tours. We pride ourselves on creating an inclusive environment, with a strong emphasis on development and giving back to the community.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Perth Ultimate scene has been gradually expanding over the past 20 years, and we are excited to be able to give back to the community that has given us so much, by giving young players an opportunity to play and improve in our favourite sport.
        </p>

        <p>
        Bullseye is partnered with Shenton College to provide Ultimate coaching after school, and we are stoked to have a place for our young members test their skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Street League Ultimate</h2>

        <p>

        Street League is an Ultimate league that started earlier this year by a group of super passionate people, who thought they could run a league even better than what already existed in Perth. And they were right! They are now an incorporated club and ready to include youth in their league.
        </p>
        <p>

        Jono Jones and Ben Gaudin are Bullseye coaches that have been providing Youth Ultimate at Shenton since the start of 2021 and will be the Captains/Coaches at these games, providing coaching and making sure that everything runs smoothly.
        </p>

        <p>
        To help keep the team fun and competitive, as well as providing plenty of coaching opportunities, we will have some senior Bullseye members playing too.
